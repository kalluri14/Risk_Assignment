# Risk_Assignment
Making a Web App for checking stocks using django and SQlite database and react 

first we create our django project here it is named "B" in that we have our finance folder under which we can get models .py file in which we need to firt define all the attributes of our databse .

then we make migrations so that it gets connected to our database and then with the help of sqlite exe we can view our database in our project editor itself.

Till here we have imported  our csv files into our sqlite databse using sqlite exe which helps us work from command line itself.

The two files that is equities.csv and daily_returns csv are added into our dbsqlite3 databse under the names finance_equities and finance_daily_returns.
